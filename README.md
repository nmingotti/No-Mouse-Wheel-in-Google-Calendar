# No-Mouse-Wheel-in-Google-Calendar
GreaseMonkey UserScript to prevent mouse scrolling in Google Calendar. 
Mouse Scroll in Google Calendar changes the month, which is for me a very annoying feature.

This little script was adapted from the code of Ivan Morgillo available for Chrome to work in FireFox.

It has been teste working in Firefox ESR 45.3.0 in Linux Debian 8.
